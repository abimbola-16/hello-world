It is part of the global Girls' Brigade movement, which began in the United Kingdom in 1893. Here's a brief history of the Girls' Brigade in Nigeria:

Early Beginnings and Establishment in Nigeria
The Girls' Brigade (GB) was founded by a Scottish woman, Lady Helen Liddell, in 1893, in Glasgow, Scotland. Its mission was to bring young girls together for spiritual and personal development through Bible study, practical skills, and recreational activities.

The movement spread to several countries, including Nigeria, in the early 20th century. The Girls' Brigade Nigeria was officially established in 1953. This followed the earlier introduction of the Boys' Brigade in the country, which was established in 1932. The Girls' Brigade quickly gained popularity, especially in Christian communities.

Since its establishment, the Girls' Brigade Nigeria has grown substantially, with branches in almost all parts of the country.

The organization is structured into various age groups, including the Explorers (5-8 years), Juniors (9-12 years), Seniors (13-18 years), and Young Women (19-30 years). Each group is aimed at different stages of personal development and includes activities like Bible study, leadership training, music, arts, and community service.
